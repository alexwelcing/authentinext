# GDPR-members-only-publication

Demo of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v9.4.0 next-create-app deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) set up to be instantly deployed by [Cassidoo](https://github.com/cassidoo/). All I'm doing is breaking stuff, trying to add a banner managing cookies with the post deployment script.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cassidoo/members-only&utm_source=github&utm_medium=identitystarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex)

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

## Wake it up!

I choose yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Installation options

1. Visit this repo: `git clone https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter.git`
2. Read the real instructions!
3. Pick the Install Option #1 95% of the time, it works well.
4. If you choose to connect to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)
